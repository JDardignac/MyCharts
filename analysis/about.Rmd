## Hello there thanks for stopping by my website. How about you learn a little about me!


My name is Jessica Dardignac and I am from a small town in New Jersey. I was raised by my parents along side my two older brother and my lovely dog Benji! I got my Bachlours in Biology at Fairleigh Dickenson University. Now I am pursuing my Masters in Science at Villanova Univeristy.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(grid)

# Set the working directory to where your image is located
setwd("C://Users//Jmons//OneDrive//Documents//R-Class work//Photos")

library(jpeg)

# Read the image file
img <- readJPEG("Photo_of_benji.jpg") # You can also use readJPEG() for JPEG files or readTIFF() for TIFF files

# Display the image
grid::grid.raster(img)

## Some fun facts about me

I geek out on video games and anime

I live with the curse of if I see someone do it online I think its easy and that I could do (maybe better)

My favorite time of year is fall

Im not a very good swimmer
